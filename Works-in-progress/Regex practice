$regex='(?<=\s+)\d+(?=\s+[a-z])'
## (?<=\s+) says to search after any number of white spaces. (?=\s+[a-z]) says to search before any number of white spaces that are immediately followed
##by a ltter. \d+ says we're looking for 1 or more numbers. All together, the above searches for any number(s) preceeded by at least 1 white space,
##followed by at least 1 white space then any letter. If you look at the output of quser, the only text that matches those requirements are the sessionIDs.

$sessionid = quser | select-string -allmatches $regex | % {logoff $_.matches.value}
$sessionid.matches.value | foreach {write-host $_}


$regex='(?<=more\.).*(?=\s+)'
